# Kaggle-spooky-author feature extraction
I am woking on spooky author kaggle project to predict the author without using tf idf. The only thing i am using is by extracting features from the sentance. Altough right now the model is not good and gives less than 40 performance, I am working on it improve performance. Anyway the no of features i pulled out can be used with any NLP project. Some are common some are creative. Anyone is open how i can improve the model.
